INTRODUCTION

Below you'll find some excerpts of the first mail I (Jean-Louis Paquelin) have
exchanged with the rStep author (Reza Naima). It could be the seed of an
installation documentation.

jrStepGUI is a Java rStep Graphic User Interface. It is supposed to be
platform independent. Actually, it depends on the availability of the RXTX
library which handles the serial communications between a computer and the
Arduino.

INSTALLATION

Before using jrStepGUI, you have to install the RXTX library. If you are under
linux/windows/osx, download the library's archive and follow the instructions
given in the file. Alternatively, you can try the library's web install. It
should be easier to proceed this way, but I'm not shure it works.

If you are running a less common OS, go to the RXTX website in the Download
section or browse their repository, you need both the RXTXcomm.jar and the
native library depending on your OS.

RXTX library:
	http://www.rxtx.org/
RXTX library archive:
	http://rxtx.qbang.org/pub/rxtx/rxtx-2.1-7-bins-r2.zip
RXTX web install:
	http://show.docjava.com:8086/book/cgij/code/jnlp/gnu.io.SafeCommDriver.jnlp
RXTX for all OSes:
	http://rxtx.qbang.org/ToyBox/2.1-7-build1/
	
btw, you need a working JRE 1.5 or greater.

Once the library is installed, you'll just have to run jrStepGUI.jar.

  After upgrading the rStep firmware from r11 to r25 something went wrong with
  the startup string and I had to change to handle regular expressions.
