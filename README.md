rStep
=====

rStep is an open-source project which incorporates hardware & firmware & software to simplify the implementation 
of a CNC device. The overarching goals are minimal cost, simple hardware (no dedicated PC requirement), and easy 
to use software.

Hardware & Firmware
-------------------
rStep aims to simplify the process by incorporating a gcode interpreter designed to run inside a microcontroller 
which is tightly integrated with stepper motor controllers and a DC motor controller. The firmware & hardware are 
designed to be compatible with the Arduino suite of tools and libraries to allow for beginners to quickly add 
functionality and customisations. The first version has been designed as an Arduino plug-n-play shield.

tinker and happen to use GitHub over Google Code.**
